            <dd>
                Prior to taking this course, I knew a fair amount about HTML and CSS. I have been using
                the social media website Tumblr for around eight years now. On Tumblr, you could edit the way
                your blog looks using HTML and CSS. I started playing around with the code and eventually created an
                entire theme from scratch! Some of the advanced CSS techniques I used in this assignment were changing
                the properties of the navigation links upon hover, creating the footer with a curved radius, and
                using the box model to modify element spacing. I really liked
                being able to code an entire website from scratch because I got to design it exactly how I was picturing in my head.
                I didn't like the lack of knowledge I had about some of the designs I wanted to implement, but I had a lot of
                resources to learn from.

            <dt><a href=".\Lab2\single-page.html">Lab 2</a> - Responsive Web Design</dt>
            <dd>
                This lab taught me how to change elements of my CSS style code based on the dimensions of the browser. This
                makes it so that the mobile browser view of the website looks different than the desktop web browser view.
                The mobile view is less cluttered, changes the size of some elements and changes the view of the navigation. I liked
                being able to play around with how things look in the mobile view, but I disliked having to constantly mess around and
                change aspects of the code in separate places. This was a little confusing to keep track of. I really liked how the
                information/music section turned out.

            <dt><a href=".\Lab3\datingApp.html">Lab 3</a> - Javascript</dt>
            <dd>
                This lab taught me about Javascript and how to manipulate the DOM to dynamically add content to the page. I created objects,
                added them to an array, then used the select menus to filter out the profiles to the given attributes. I liked being able to
                make something that was interactive with the user. I didn't know anything about Javascript before this lab, and a lot of it
                had somewhat similar concepts to the coding languages I already knew, but I feel like more guidance would've been nice. I also
                didn't like how unnecessary it was to add forty whole profiles to the application. Overall, I'm proud of my project.

            <dt><a href=".\Lab4\datingApp.html">Lab 4</a> - Javascript II</dt>
            <dd>
                This lab taught me more about Javascript and how to manipylate the DOM to dynamically add content to the page in a more advanced
                way. I used the browser's local storage to store users that can be accessed on more than one page and won't be deleted upon
                refreshing. I feel like the project was a little more advanced than I was expecting, but after working through it for a while, I figured
                everything out. I also utilized the browser breakpoints to better understand the errors in my code.

            <dt><a href=".\Tutorial\intro.html">Tutorial Project</a> - Web Application</dt>
            <dd>
                We provided knowledge of Angular 2.0. Showed step-by-step instructions on how to set up the Angular environment to finally, demonstrating a project that one can do at home.

                For us, we found that it wasn't the project that was hard but the installation is very lengthy. We have to take each step carefully because every step was provided in order to make sure our projects work 100% accurately.

            <dt><a href=".\Lab6\application.html">Lab 6</a> - Web API Research</dt>
            <dd>
                This lab taught me how to implement API's published by other people/companies. I got more familiar with AJAX and JQuery and how manipulate the page using data
                retreived in a JSON file from the API source. My application ended using eleven of the services provided by The Movie Database's API and allowed the user
                to search for people, movies, and TV shows. They could also view upcoming movies, trending movies and TV shows, and top rated movies and TV shows. I liked seeing all of the information
                that I could retrieve from the API's databases and I liked styling the page. One of the things I learned that was cool was that
                to make it so the AJAX functions run in a specific order, you have to nest them into one another.
