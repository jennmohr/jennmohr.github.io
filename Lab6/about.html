            <p class="lead">For Lab 6, I decided to use version 3 of The Movie Database (TMDb) API. </p>
            <p class="lead">The home page of my application allows you to use three of the API's features. You can search by movie, by TV shows, and by people using the API's <b>Search Movies</b>, <b>Search TV Shows</b>, and <b>Search People</b> features
    .
    After searching for a movie, TV show, or person, the application allows you to go through and view
    every result of your search query. Once you find the information you were looking for, the application shows you the more details about your search.
    For movies and TV shows, the application uses the API's features of <b>Get Details</b>, <b>Get Credits</b>, <b>Get Similar</b>.
</p>
            <p class="lead">For people, the application uses the API's features for <b>Get Details</b> and <b>Get Combined Credits</b>. All of this information
            is displayed to the user. </p>
            <p class="lead">The discover page of my application allows you to discover trending, top rated, and coming soon movies and TV shows. It uses the API's <b>Get Top Rated</b> and <b>Get Upcoming</b> features, as well as the <b>Get Trending</b> feature. All of the information displayed to the user is provided by The Movie Database's API. The application uses AJAX and JQuery to implement its functionality.</p>
