            <h3>Let's get started!</h3>
            In order to get started, we need to create the environment on our machines
            to be able to code and run our projects as well as have all libraries set up.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="install">
        <h3>Step 1: Download Node.JS</h3>
        <p>
            To use Angular 2, you have to download Node onto your machine by visiting
            nodejs.org. The home page comes to provide the download link that is
            compatible for your machine. Download the LTS version which is recommended
            for most users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is what you might find on the website's home page if you're a Mac user.
            The website displays the download links based off of your machine's operating system.
        </p>
        <img class="nodeSetUp" src="images/nodeDownload.png" alt="" />
    </div>

    <div class="install">
        <h3>Step 2: Open Command Prompt/ Terminal</h3>
        <p>
            After installing the latest version, open up either the Command
            Prompt for Windows or Terminal for Mac OS. Spelling is crucial
            so make sure the commands you type are correctly typed before running them.
        </p>
        <p>Windows users should type in the command:</p> <code>npm install -g typescript</code>
        <p>Mac users should type in the command:</p> <code>sudo npm install -g typescript</code>
        <p> Press the enter button to run the command line. With this, we installed TypeScript globally onto our machine.</p>
        <p>Next, type in this command:</p>

        <p><strong>Windows:</strong></p><code>npm install -g typings</code>
        <p><strong>Mac OS:</strong></p><code>sudo npm install -g typings</code>
    </div>

    <div class="install">
        <h3>Step 3: Download a Text Editor</h3>
        <p>
            After this is done installing, you need to download and
            open a text editor that supports typescript, such as <strong>Microsoft Visual Studio</strong>.
            Any form of Visual Studio is fine just as long as it supports typsecript.
            If a version is to be recommended, We would say Visual Studio Code or Community would work best.
        </p>

        <img class="vsSetUp" src="images/vsDownload.png" alt="" />
        <p>
            For this tutorial, we have Visual Code here and just like Nodejs.org,
            The website recognized my operating system and had an option to download with a click of a button.
            the dropdown shows other version to download as well.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="install">
        <h3>Step 4: Download Github and Install Dependencies</h3>
        <p>
            Although it is possible to set up your application from scratch,
            it is preferred to use Angular Github because of the dependencies needed.
            Visit Github.com and a download tab should display at the top. Click on the tab
            you will find yourself with the website presenting,yet again, a version of github
            compatible for your operating system for you to download.
        </p>
        <img class="gitSetUp" src="images/gitDownload.png" alt="" />
        <p>
            The page should look like this.We had previous examples for a macOS system but this is for Windows.
            After the download is complete, please follow the installation steps.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, go to<code>https://github.com/angular/quickstart</code>.
            This url will help aid us get a clone of the repository.
        </p>
        <p>
            Open up your command prompt/terminal and we are going to run command lines
            to create a project directory. We will be naming this project directly as
            'allergen'. This will later play a roll in our Demo.To start run this line of code:
        </p>
        <code>mkdir allergen</code>

        <p>
            We will now enter the directory with this next command in order to clone the repository
            into the 'allergen' folder that we just created:
        </p>

        <code>cd allergen</code>

        <p>Then, run this line of code to clone:</p>
        <code>git clone https://github.com/angular/quickstart Demo</code>

        <p>If you realized, we are using the url link in our command to extract the files we need.</p>
        <p>
            Open the cloned code in Visual Studio, or another text editor that you are using.
            Find the 'allergen' folder and open it.
        </p>
        <p>Go back to the command prompt/terminal and go into your 'Demo' folder by typing the command:</p>
        <code>cd Demo</code>

        <p>Next, type the command and press enter:</p>

        <p><strong>Windows:</strong></p><code>npm install</code>

        <p><strong>Mac OS:</strong></p><code>sudo npm install</code>

        <p>You might get a message stating packages need “funding”, if that does come up
            on terminal run this command</p>

        <p><strong>Windows:</strong></p><code>npm audit fix</code>

        <p><strong>Mac OS:</strong></p><code>sudo npm audit fix</code>

        <p>It might not come up and that is totally fine. You can skip this and continue to 
        finish the process by running the last command which is: </p>

        <p><strong>Windows:</strong></p><code>npm start</code>

        <p><strong>Mac OS:</strong></p><code>sudo npm start</code>

        <h3>
            You finished the installation! Keep your terminal open and running and click on the 'Demo' tab up top to get started on
            learning how to use Angular 2 to create a project.
