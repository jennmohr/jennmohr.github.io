            <h3> Welcome to Our Tutorial!</h3>

            We will be building a web application that allows us to select a restaurant,
            input your food allergies or dietary restrictions and will show the user what 
            they can and cannot eat from that restaurant. 
            <br><br><h3>What is Angular?</h3>
            <blockquote>-Google created this OpenSource client side JS framework in 2010 <br><br>
            -It is a single page application framework. It’s a form of javascript where written code can be easily tested by unit testing.<br><br>
            -The main concept for this application is so that the html page and the javascript logic can be developed at the same time which gives us faster productivity for unit testing. <br>
        </blockquote><br><br>
            <h3>Why was Angular 2 created?</h3>
            <blockquote></blockquote>
            - Renewal of the original Angular in 2.0 version in 2014.. <br><br>
            - In this current framework, controllers and $cope have been removed and are replaced by components and directives. <br><br>
            - This is a framework for building complex application in the browser<br><br>
            Introduces a number of new features:
            <blockquote>- Support for modern browsers and mobile development <br><br>
            - Moved many functionality into modules to make it easier to us ein third party libraries <br><br>
            - The use of TypeScript: TypeScript is a superset of JS and adds features like static typing and class based object-oriented programming <br>
