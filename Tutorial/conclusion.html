        <h2>And There You Have It! We Learned Angular 2.0!</h2>

        <p>In this Angular 2.0 tutorial, we learned how this javascript 
        framework came to be what it is now. We demonstrated how to set up and build a project and got 
        your elbows dirty while taking it step by step on how you can use angular in a project that 
        we demonstrated for you.</p>

        <p>This framework is great for designing websites and mobile applications</p>

        <p>that <i>'allergen'</i> folder we created during our installation turned into more than just a form.
        The main purpose for you, the user, to see what that what we created can actually be used for 
        real life purposes and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the website is too sort through the menu options of the 3 
        restaurant menus we created based on specific allergies someone may have. This website enables a person 
        to find something they can actually eat without holding up a line because they may not know the ingredients.
        We also created a form page that takes user inputs of other allergies we should consider and type of food they may be interested 
        that we should also provide on our 'website'. The form also includes a place to enter an email address for subscriptions on updates.</p>
        <p>We provided knowledge of Angular 2.0. Showed step-by-step instructions on how to set up
        the Angular environment to finally, demonstrating a project that one can do at home.</p>

        <p>For us, we found that it wasn't the project that was hard but the installation is very lengthy. 
        We have to take each step carefully because every step was provided in order to make sure our 
        projects work 100% accurately.</p>
